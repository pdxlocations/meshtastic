This library provides a command line interface (CLI) for managing the user settings of Meshtastic nodes and provides an easy API for sending and receiving messages over mesh radios. Events are delivered using a publish-subscribe model, and you can subscribe to only the message types you are interested in.

The [Meshtastic-python repo](https://github.com/meshtastic/Meshtastic-python) and [API documentation](https://python.meshtastic.org) are excellent sources of information.

If you wish to view the code or contribute to development of the python library or the command line interface, please visit the Meshtastic python [GitHub page](https://github.com/meshtastic/Meshtastic-python).

There are standalone executables for Windows and Ubuntu if you do not want to install python and/or the python libraries required to run the meshtastic CLI tool. See [Standalone](#standalone) for more information.

Installation can also be easily done through the [Python package installer pip](https://pypi.org/project/meshtastic):
:::note
You must use pip version 20 or later. To upgrade to the latest pip, do: `pip install --upgrade pip`
:::
:::info
Make sure that the `PATH variable` also gets installed by checking the box while installing python. If you don't, python may not be available and you may not be able to call `meshtastic` from your CLI. If you do forget to check that box, you will need to install the path environment variable for python on your operating system.

:::important
You may need to install a driver from Silicon Labs for the [CP210X USB to UART bridge](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers)

Some newer boards may require the drivers for the [CH9102](http://www.wch.cn/downloads/CH343SER_ZIP.html) or [Direct Download](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/CH9102_Driver) for Windows 7.
