The user config options are: Long Name, Short Name, and Is Licensed. User config uses an admin message sending a `User` protobuf.

## User Config Values

### Long Name

A personalized name for your device.

Auto-generated by default.

If you are a licensed HAM operator and have enabled `IsLicensed`, this should be set to your HAM operator call sign.

### Short Name

A personalized short identifier for your device.

Auto-generated by default.

### Is Licensed (HAM)

If you are a licensed HAM operator and have considered the [privileges and restrictions](/docs/faq/#what-is-the-benefit-of-using-my-ham-license-with-meshtastic) of using Meshtastic with a HAM license, enable this flag.

Disabled by default.

By enabling `IsLicensed`, you should also review the following related configurations:

- **User:** `LongName` (Should be your Call Sign)
- **Channel:** `PSK` (Should be Empty, removing encryption)

Please see instructions for [Enabling HAM License](/docs/software/python/cli/usage#ham-radio-support)

:::tip

Because the device will reboot after each command is sent via CLI, it is recommended when setting multiple values in a config section that commands be chained together as one.

```shell title="Example:"
meshtastic --set-owner 'your node name' --set-owner-short  'NODE'
```

:::

```shell title="Set the LongName Value"
meshtastic --set-owner 'your node name'
```

```shell title="Set the ShortName Value"
meshtastic --set-owner-short  'NODE'
```

```shell title="Enable Ham Mode, set name to license, disable encryption"
